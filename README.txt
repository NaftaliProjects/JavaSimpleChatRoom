above is simple Chat Room Java application. 
showing my use-case of: 
	Socket Stream (ipv4 , TCP),
	MultiThreading programming 
	and JavaFxml. 

the project is splitted in to two apps : {Server , Client}. 

to run : 
	first run (or complieAndRun) the server side
	and only then run (or compileAndRun) the client side.

to join the chatRoom:
	follow the guide on the client side GUI

enjoy :D
